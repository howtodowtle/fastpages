    "Try not to get analysis paralysis, just choose one. You're not married to the dataset you choose, but get to know it.\n",

    "## Get 100% accuracy on one instance/batch of your data\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than wasting your time loading all of the data each time you want to check for bugs, create a _tiny dataset_ with just one instance of your dataset and overfit it with a very simple model.\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Get 100% accuracy on around 10% of your data\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you can overfit your model on one instance, begin using more of your data and try to overfit it by adding more layers. Don't use any regularization for the moment (e.g., Dropout, L1/ L2 regularization), this is another sanity preserving tip so you know that your model is learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Add all of your training data\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you add all of your data, if training is taking too long, leave it aside as an experiment and continue your work on the 10% of data. If you're overfitting when you add more layers and all of your data, here's five steps to reduce overfitting."

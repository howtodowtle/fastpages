I'm from Dublin, Ireland 🇮🇪 and living in Edinburgh, Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 

I'm currently interested in Deep Learning with Audio, Python software development, data visualisation and bits and bobs from lots of other areas.

I was working as a web/mobile software developer for a few years and then went back to university to do an MSc in AI in Heriot Watt University, Edinburgh.

I'm now working as a Research Engineer in [Speech Graphics](https://www.speech-graphics.com)
